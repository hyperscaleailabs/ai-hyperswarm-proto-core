# Architecture

`hsai` is deliberately small. External side effects live in thin wrapper modules
so the decision logic stays pure and unit-tested.

## Modules

| module | responsibility | side effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hsai.config` | load & validate `.ai-swarm/core.yaml` | read file |
| `hsai.proc` | one subprocess wrapper (`run`) + `Runner` type | subprocess |
| `hsai.models` | task → model-tier selection (heuristic-v0) | none (pure) |
| `hsai.ai` | drive `claude -p`; enforce subscription-only | subprocess, env |
| `hsai.gitops` | worktrees, sync, branch, commit, push | git |
| `hsai.github` | tickets, labels, PRs, merge | gh |
| `hsai.ci` | local CI gate (ruff+pytest) + remote status | subprocess |
| `hsai.knowledge` | lessons, whitepapers, MOC reindex (Obsidian) | write files |
| `hsai.orchestrator` | one iteration; `decide_path`, `build_pr_body` (pure) | composes above |
| `hsai.swarm` | run N iterations concurrently | threads |
| `hsai.cli` | `hsai` entry point | - |

## Testability

Every wrapper takes an injectable `runner` (default: real subprocess). Tests
inject a fake runner or use `dry_run=True`, so CI never touches the network.
The pure core - `decide_path`, `build_pr_body`, `models.select`, the knowledge
renderers - is tested directly.

## Safety model

- **Subscription-only:** `ai.preflight` refuses to run if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  is present but not declared removable; the child env is always sanitized.
- **Never commit to main:** all work happens on `hsai/iter-*` branches in
  dedicated worktrees.
- **Green-gated merges:** merges use `gh pr merge --auto`; with branch
  protection requiring the `ci` check, broken changes simply never merge.
- **Traceability:** no PR without a ticket, a recorded model, and a lesson.

## Headless permission mode

`claude -p` runs with `execution.permission_mode` from `core.yaml`
(default `acceptEdits`). For fully unattended operation this can be raised, at
the cost of granting the agent broader autonomy inside its worktree. Because
merges are green-gated, a bad change is contained to an unmerged PR.

## Concurrency

`swarm.run_parallel` uses a thread pool (workers are subprocess/IO-bound). Each
worker gets its own worktree and branch, so there is no shared checkout. The
shared surface is the GitHub backlog and `main`; green-gated auto-merge
serializes the actual integration.
